Situational awareness in a disaster is critical to effective response. Resources are scattered across large areas and communications are impaired. Disaster responders require timely delivery of high volumes of accurate data to make effective decisions. DistressNet is an adhoc wireless architecture that supports disaster response with distributed collaborative sensing, topology-aware routing using a multi-channel protocol, and accurate resource localization. Sensing suites use collaborative and distributed mechanisms to optimize data collection and minimize total energy use. Message delivery is aided by novel topology management while congestion is minimized through the use of mediated, multi-channel radio protocols. Novel estimation techniques improve localization accuracy in difficult environments.
